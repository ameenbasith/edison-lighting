# edison-lighting
Utilizing my intel edison (with arduino expansion) to control my Nanoleaf light panels!

## language
Python or C++, will decide soon

## ideal solution
Ideally, I would want to control BOTH my LIFX Tiles AND my Nanoleaf panels, and match the scences on both. Although this may be possible on apple home, it isn't as matched as I would like it to be.
